# **AlphaTeam Project**
## **Overview**
This project is designed for Module 1 of the Algorithmics Course.

## **Project Description**
Our project aims to create a website based on a design received from the software known as FIGMA. As the Team Leader, I divided our tasks into five sections, corresponding to the number of members in our group. I assigned different deadlines to each member based on the difficulty of the task.

## **Team Collaboration**
Each member of our group performed their tasks admirably, with each member responsible for creating code for three sections (desktop, tablet, and mobile), along with an adaptive layout. We engaged in brainstorming sessions, collectively solved issues, and used Trello to keep our Team Leader informed about the project's status.

## **Version Control**
Upon completing their tasks, each team member added their files to our team's repository. I reviewed the code and provided feedback where necessary. Subsequently, we merged all the files into the main branch. Our QA Tester conducted the final quality assurance checks before we pushed the project's final version to the main branch.

## **Feedback**
We greatly appreciate your attention and look forward to receiving your feedback.
